jason mraz - a beautiful mess

You've got the best of both worlds
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy
Humble but you're greedy
Based on your body language
And shouted cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective
But your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
